# Nebula CSS Framework

## Usage
If you don't want to use Nebula in a Sass/SCSS workflow, just grab the `nebula.css` file from the `css` directory, and include that in your website. That's all.

If you want to customise colors, spacing & other things, you need to use Sass to recompile changes made in the `scss/nebula` directory, here's how:

## Demo
You can see the code in action at [marcohamersma.github.io/nebula.css/](http://marcohamersma.github.io/nebula.css/).

### Install Global Dependancies
  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)
  * [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)
  * [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)
  * [grunt.js](http://grunt.js)

### Install Local Dependancies
  * Download zip or clone the repo
  * cd to project folder
  * run `bundle install` (first time users)
  * run `[sudo] npm install` (first time users)
  * run `grunt` (to watch and compile Sass files)

I'm hoping that I can remove the dependency on Ruby soon, but I haven't gotten to it yet, so for now it's still required for using `grunt-contrib-sass`.
